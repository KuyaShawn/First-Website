				<p><h3 style="width: 500px; margin-left: 20px;">
					Reliable Transmission Shop &amp; Repair has been in the mechanic industry
					for a while now. We first started as a transmission shop, but then
					progressed to work with more cars and parts. As we start to work with more
					car models and more expensive brands we took the time to grow our business
					by hiring the best professionals out there to repair your car in any given
					situation, we also took the time to get the right machinery to help with
					these difficult tasks to makes it easier for us to replace and repair, so
					give us a try and let us help you!

					Overall, we care for the health of everyone's transmission and engine, but because
					many people do forget to maintain their transmission fluid and only see oil
					changes to be the sole purpose of maintaining a car. Even though modern
					engines and transmission are made to last for quite a while, us
					professionals recommend you to do a regular checkup on fluids either by us
					or by yourself as it is very quick and easy to do. So, then you would not
					have to worry about having your transmission being repaired anytime soon as
					it is very costly.

				<p><h3 style="width: 500px; margin-left: 20px; position:relative; top: -50px; right: 0px; float: left;">
					For our transmission repairs, we will open up your transmission and check
					to see if your gears and synchro's are damaged, having these things chipped
					is very common as it's just worn and tear from the daily use of your car.
					And depending on what transmission you have like a manual transmission, we
					will check if your clutch and flywheels are still good and aren't worn out
					which will cause slipping when trying to drive off. Lastly, once we have
					checked out which components needed, those parts will be replaced with
					original or with better parts so you won't have to worry about them for a
					while.

					Reliable Transmission Shop &amp; Repair specializes in transmission repairs
					and currently been doing it ever since we have started and as we know, your
					transmission is a vital part of your car as it helps it moving your car. By
					time and each usage, your car's transmission will someday retire, this is
					where we come to help as plenty of people go through this process.
				</h3></p>
				<p><h3 style="width: 500px; margin-left: 20px; position:relative; top: -40px; left: 0px; float: right;">
					In our Transmission checkups we usually clean out your transmission to see
					if any leakages occur when the car is on and when the wheels are spinning,
					this usually helps us spot the problem right away as it helps pinpoint on
					which component needed to be opened. Another thing we check is for cracks
					or holes in your transmission, this is usually caused by overwhelming the
					transmission or driving a car with no transmission fluid left, this type of
					damage is usually the worst ones. As you would probably need a new
					transmission. Lastly, we check for the fluid in your transmission if it is
					low or if the fluid is very dirty. With these checkups, you will have a
					healthy running transmission for a while.
